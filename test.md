# Getting Started
=================

These are some basic survival instructions to get a local instance of dailydot.com
installed and running. Some elbow grease will need to be put into making this easier
and more portable. However, with these directions and some luck, you'll be up and running!

If this is a clean and fresh build install please be sure to read the
[dependency section](#dependencies) to insure installation of all required software,
modules and libraries.


# Creating and Building Instance

if this is a new system build follow these [steps](#installing) to install the dependent
software. Once all dependant software has been installed ensure that to following software is
started and running.

[Redis Server](#redis)

[ElasticSearch](#elasticsearch)


## Database downloading and importing

### Switch to database user account
    
    sudo su - postgres

### Create database

    createdb dailydot -T template0 -E UTF8

### Login to  Heroku via Heroku-cli
    heroku login
 
### Get Database snapsot
    wget -O snapshot.dump `heroku pg:backups public-url -q --app dailydot`
    
### Load Data into Database
    
    pg_restore --verbose --clean --no-acl --no-owner -j 4 -d dailydot snapshot.dump

### Connect to the Daily Dot PostgreSQL database, change that user to superuser, and grant it all privileges on all Daily Dot tables

    psql dailydot
    alter user postgres superuser;
    grant all privileges on all tables in schema public to postgres;
    (quit psql)


## Cloning and Initializing Git Repository


    git clone https://github.com/dailydot/dailydot.com.git 
    cd dailydot.com
    virtualenv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -U pip setuptools wheel
    pip install -r requirements.txt -r ./requirements/dev.txt

## Indexing for ElasticSearch (make sure ElasticSearch is running) Age is in hours

    python manage.py update_index --age=168 -v 2 -b 100 -k 4 -u default

## Starting the Django server

    python manage.py runserver 0.0.0.0:8000


Once you see, "Starting development server at http://0.0.0.0:8000/", 
visit [localhost:8000 in your browser](http://localhost:8000) to load it up. 
The first load may take a while, as the Redis cache may need to populate.

# Notes

## OS Issues

    Several flavors of Ubuntu were used during the creation of this note below are Issues that were discovered
 
    
|   Distribution       |  Version     |  Comments                                                  |
|----------------------|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Ubuntu               | 14.04        | The default Python version that sips with this distro is .7.6. This causes an issue with the ssl libraries of the modules and 3rd party addons. this issue is to hand build and install7.8 or above of python.|
|                      | 15.04        | The apt-get package for ElasticSearch while loads with-out error refuses to start. It gives no error or log entries. *** Additional investigation is required.***|
|                      | 15.10        | Durning the testing of this Distribution there was a fatal error that is currently unresolved.|

## Python:

    Python rev should be greater then 2.7.8
    
        
### Python Django-Nose

    Django-Nose is required to be installed into the virtualenv so It's not installed in the initial phases of the
    Python-Core updates.

{sre}
## Redis:

### Redis Ports
        
    Default server is at port 6379 once installed to start the server (Ubuntu 15.04)
   further
### Starting/Stopping Redis

#### Manual install start and stop

    sudo service redis_6379 start
    sudo service redis_6379 stop

#### apt-get install start stop instructions

    Currently while the server is starting it is returning a file not found error.
    *** This is still under investigation ***
    
    sudo service redis-server start
    sudo service redis-server start
    
### Testing Redis

    Stating the redis-cli is a good way to ensure you have the service up and
    running

    redis-cli
    redis 127.0.0.1:6379>

## ElasticSearch:

### Discoveries and Observations

    During the testing of these instructions the package available from Unbuntu loaded
    without incendent. However it failed to start the service. This is why the apt-get
    install instructions have been replaced with manual install & start instructions

{ses}
### Starting ElasticSearch

    cd /usr/share/elasticsearch
    ./bin/elasticsearch&

### Testing ElasticSearch
    curl  connect to http://localhost:9200

    curl localhost:9200

### Result should be

    {
        "status" : 200,
        "name" : "Tefral the Surveyor",
        "version" : {
          "number" : "1.0.3",
          "build_hash" : "NA",
          "build_timestamp" : "NA",
          "build_snapshot" : false,
          "lucene_version" : "4.6"
        },
        "tagline" : "You Know, for Search"
      }
